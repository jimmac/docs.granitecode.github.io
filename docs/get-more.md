# Get More From Granite

The getting started tutorial introduced some of the basic Granite.Code features. However, there are many other things you can do with Granite.Code. It is also possible to make Granite's basic features more powerful, by adding context to your queries.

## Ask about a code base

You can also Granite questions about an entire code project. This can be useful for learning how a project works, or finding ways to improve a project.

To ask a question about a codebase, you can either:

* Include **@Codebase** in your chat query, or
* Enter your query and click the **Ctrl⏎ @codebase** button, or
* Enter your query and press **Ctrl+⏎**

Examples of the type of question you can ask about a codebase include:

* TODO
* TODO
* TODO

## Ask about files, docs, folders, diffs, and more

Codebases are just one type of context that you can add to a query. Granite.Code's powerful context feature allows adding a range of different types of context, to allow you to ask questions about different aspects of a project. Supported context types include files, docs, Git diffs, and folders.

To add context to query or instruction, just type an **@** symbol, and a list of available context types will be shown. You can also click the **@** button in the chat prompt.

Examples of context-based queries you can ask include:

* TODO
* TODO
* TODO

## Make different types of changes

The Granite.Code context menu also includes a set of actions that can be performed on a selected code snippet, including:

* Fixing grammar and spelling mistakes
* Fixing errors in your code
* Optimizing code
* Adding code comments

## Add docs

Adding documentation sites to Granite.Code gives the AI model access to additional information about the technologies being used in your project, and allows it to give more accurate and helpful responses. It is therefore a good idea to add the docs sites for the main technologies being used. When a docs site is added, the Granite.Code crawls the site and makes the content available locally to the AI model.

To add docs for your project:

* Click the docs button above the chat prompt
* Enter a title and URL for the docs site you want to make available
* Click add, and wait for indexing to complete
